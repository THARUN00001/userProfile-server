# Getting Started with Node app


In the project directory, you can run:

### `git clone https://github.com/THARUN00001/userProfile-server`
### `cd userProfile-server`
### `npm install`
### `nodemon server.js`


### it logs "Server running on port 4000" wn server is up n running


#### .env file and prisma generate file is also provided in the repo to make the evaluation easier for you to run without creating a DB on prisma-ORM and linking it to the application (currently running on my prism-ORM DB).
